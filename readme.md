# Password Generator Program

## Overview

This program generates secure passwords based on user preferences. The user can specify the length of the password and
choose which characters to include (letters, digits, special symbols). The program also includes functionality to save
generated passwords to a file and assess the strength of the passwords.

## Steps to Implement

1. **Study the task requirements**: Understand what is required for the project.
2. **Import necessary modules**: Import the `string` and `secrets` modules from Python's standard library.
3. **Design the program structure**: Determine the necessary functions:
    - `generate_password()`
    - `get_user_preferences()`
    - `get_display_preferences()`
    - `save_passwords()`
    - `assess_password_strength()`
4. **Write the functions**: Implement each function individually.
5. **Test the functions**: Ensure each function works correctly.
6. **Assemble the program**: Combine all functions into the main program.
7. **Test the entire program**: Verify the program works as expected with different inputs.
8. **Fix errors**: Correct any issues found during testing.
9. **Document the code**: Add comments to explain the code.
10. **Prepare for use**: Ensure the program is user-friendly and ready for others to use.
